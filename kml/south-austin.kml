			<description><![CDATA[South Lamar is one of South Austin's up and coming neighborhoods. What was once more commercial and industrial is now becoming the trendy neighborhood of SoLa.

There are some single family homes in SoLa, but much of the area is made up of townhomes and duplexes, making it a hotbed for investors or owner occupants looking to get some help with their mortgage.
